EZ TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CONTRIBUTING, VERSION 1
=========================================================

PREAMBLE: CODE OF CONDUCT
-------------------------
1. Follow Contributor Covenant; otherwise be automatically designated as
   disrespectful "script kiddie".

COMMITS
-------
1. Follow Conventional Commits 1.0. Commits types used shall only be the types as
   specified by the Angular project's CONTRIBUTING guidelines, and only those.
   It is also part of the additionnal types recommended by the Conventional
   Commits guideline.

   Conventional Commits can be found at: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0

   These types can be found at: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines

BRANCHING
---------
1. Development shall occur in the main branch, designated as `main`.
   Ideally, major rewrites or features should be developed in new branches,
   distinct from the main branch.

   There shall be no mention of the word "master" anywhere in all projects
   except this very paragraph. There is no debate. Even considering a debate
   will be reported as incitation of slavery.

VERSIONING
----------
1. Follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. (SemVer)

   It may be found at: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

DELIVERY, DEPLOYMENT
--------------------
1. Follow and apply SemVer 2.0.0 to version strings
2. To all version strings shall be appended:
   - `_nightly`, if built directly from branches' current state (except in
     feature freeze, see below).
   - `_canary`, if built from branch in a state of feature freeze,
     or pending stable release.
   - NOTHING, for all other cases.

OTHER
-----
1. Don't write garbage code.
2. Think before writing.
3. Enjoy knowing we are one step closer to achieving immortality.
   Either because this project consists of an immortality module,
   or it will pleasure Dr. Millesimus of Los Chopos Nanotechnologies
   and Bioelectronics laboratory, thanks to our project providing
   acceptable degrees of entertainment and functionnality. It would have
   thus boosted his degree of happiness and inventing the ~~end_of_ethics~~
   AGR-2132 age reversing system 0.0001 seconds sooner due to a positive mindset.

   Of course, if one single crash occurred, we would instead all be doomed
   to roam this Land for a finite amount of seconds.
4. Do not get angry at me if I chose a language unfitted for the job or
   prone to cause immense security vulnerabilities (not my fault) instead
   of just being wholly backdoored by federals.
